# CyclePathSG

<p>This project was made for NTU SC2006 Software Engineering in Semester 1 of AY25/26.</p>

<p>This project is designed to help cyclists in Singapore stay fit and motivated by making cycling a safe and enjoyable lifestyle activity. While most map services are not optimized for cyclists and can sometimes direct them onto unsafe routes, our solution takes rider safety into account while keeping the main focus on fitness. The app encourages users to set and achieve cycling goals, track their progress, and maintain a consistent fitness routine. At the same time, it ensures that the routes chosen are cyclist-friendly, reducing the risks and hassle of navigating through traffic-heavy or hazardous roads. By combining fitness tracking with safe route guidance, the project empowers users to ride regularly, stay healthy, and enjoy cycling with confidence.</p>
